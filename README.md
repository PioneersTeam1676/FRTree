## Nate testing
Nate remember to test all the following things before committing:
1. Home page loads
2. Gallery page loads
3. Search page loads
4. Clicking a link works
5. Team data loads
6. Styling looks correct
7. Re-read every line of code to make sure nate was locked in while coding.
8. Check if nate was locked in while coding

## Currently known bugs
* Search page doesn't work if nothing is entered
* Search page doesn't work with auto-filled teams

## Nate to do
* Finish editor (add saving, add link list)
* Allow users to sign up to teams with no information in them

## Options for authentication

### Option 1
Teams email us. They must prove they own the team by DMing us a secret with a proven social media, putting a document on their website with a secret, or other methods. If confirmed, we send them a code which can be used to link a password to the account. That account has access until the end of the season. That account can make changes that must be approved by us. The account expires on Jan 1 of the next year.

PROS:
* More secure
* Easier to track
* More admin discretion
CONS:
* Accounts get deleted each season, less convenient for teams

### Option 2
Teams authenticate with us and create an account. Team challenges the account owner, who must respond within 2 weeks to maintain control of the account.

PROS:
* More convenient for teams
CONS:
* Easy for a bad actor to maintain control forever
* Easy for sniper to gain control of account immediately
* Troll can spam challenge the owner to either snipe or overwhelm the account owner
* VERY insecure
